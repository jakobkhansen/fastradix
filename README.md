# A fast Radix-sort written in Python

A fast Radix-sort. Currently sequential only, could be parallelized easily.

### Usage

`sequential.radix_sequential` sorts integer arrays and returns the sorted array

### Benchmarks

The sequential algorithm starts significantly outperforming a standard Quicksort at around 10 million elements.

See `benchmarks.py` for a benchmark script.
